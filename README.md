# moonlight-reastaurant

This is a Moonlight Reastaurant Project. The Moonlight Restaurant is well-structured and includes various sections such as the homepage, about section, gallery, menu, contact form, and footer. The design uses modern layout techniques, responsive media queries, and includes features like:

## Header & Navbar:
Fixed at the top with a logo and navigation links, responsive to smaller screens with a hamburger menu.

## Home Section: 
A hero image with a welcoming message in the center.

## About Section:
Provides information about the restaurantâ€™s story, cuisine, ambiance, and commitment.

## Gallery Section:
A grid-based layout displaying images of the restaurant's dishes and interior.

## Menu Section:  
A list of menu categories, each with descriptions of the items.

## Contact Section:
Contains contact information and a form for submitting inquiries.

## Footer:
Includes social media links, support links, and contact information, and is designed to be visually aligned with the overall theme.

The embedded styles are mostly responsive, with breakpoints defined for tablet and mobile screens. The hover effects and box-shadow properties add a nice touch of interactivity.
